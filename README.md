# pipeline-generator
Declare jenkins pipelines using a json configuration file.

# try it out

This uses an example configuration of this project to demo features, it expects that you have golang installed:

  - clone this project
  - run `make example`
  - adjust the file `Pipeline.example` to point to your test jenkins server
  - execute `./ppl-example create` -- repeat until no errors are reported (it'll complain on missing jenkins plugins which you will need to install)
  - open url that is displayed
  - either wait ~1 minute or trigger the job called `test-pipeline` by hand and go back to the pipeline view
  - in order to delete the pipeline and its jobs again call `./ppl-example delete test-pipeline`

# configuration file format

the configuration for this pipeline:

![image](./example/example-config.png)

looks as follows:

    {
        "stages": [
            {
                "name": "stage0",
                "jobs": [

## stages section

The stages section contains an array of stages declarations that contain the following properties:

  - `name`: the name of the stage
  - `jobs`: an array of job declarations with the following format:
      - simple job declaration: name / command:

            {"<jobname>": "<command>"}
      - extended job declaration:

            {"<jobname>": {"cmd": "<command>", "<option1>": "<option1-value>", "<option2>": "option2-value"}, ... }

       with the following options being available:

      `artifacts`: an array of strings with artifacts (files or directories) that should be passed to the next job. If the next job is a multi job, all sub-jobs will have the listed artifacts available. If several sub-jobs of a multi-job (see below) provide artifacts, the next job after the multi job will have all artifacts of all sub jobs available: in the example, `job7` and `job8` (sub-jobs of a multi-job) will receive the artifacts `spec3/` and `spec4/` from sub-jobs `job4` and `job5`. 

      `upstream-jobs`: an array of strings with job names that should trigger this pipeline after they have a successful new build
      `downstream-jobs`: an array of strings with job names that should be triggered when this pipeline was built successfully

      `test-reports`: comma separated set of paths to junit test reports (wildcards like *.xml allowed)

      `no-clean`: if set to true, the workspace will not be cleaned before starting the job (default is to always clear workspace -- us this if you would like to cache dependencies or build artifacts between builds)

      `manual` (bool): if set to true, this job needs to be triggered manually by a user using the jenkins ui -- if omitted or set to false, job gets triggered automatically by its upstream jobs

      `localBranch` (bool): if set to true this job will check out to a local branch specified in settings 

      - multi job: an array of simple or extended job declarations (see `stage1 / job4 & job5` in example above). Those jobs will be executed in parallel:

            [<simple-job-decl>,<ext-job-decl>,<simple-job-decl>, ...]


  - `next-stages` (optional): next stages to execute when this stage has been executed successfully


## settings section

This section contains global settings for the pipeline:

  - `jenkins-server`: base url to the jenkins server
  - `git-url`: git url to the project that is to be built
  - `git-branch`: set this if you want to build a different branch to master
  - `slave-label` (optional): only execute these jobs on jenkins slave with this label
  - `job-setup` (optional): before executing each job, execute the code provided here
  - `silent` (optional): if set to true, don't send notification mails -- if omitted or false, sent mails
  - `default-name` (optional): optionally, define how your pipeline should be named here; this property will be available on 
  - `working-dir` (optional): only consider the given subdir: only builds if the subdir contains changes; changes into the subdir before executing anything, i.e. all commands are relativ to the subdir, not the repository's root
